# To-Do List App in JavaScript
A functional To-Do List App created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The to-do list has a beautiful UI, the user can add a to-do task by filling the input and hitting ENTER, after that he can rather check off the to-do task when it's done, or remove it later using the delete button. The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.
The user can clear the whole list by clicking the provided clear/refresh button at the top right corner of the app.
The to do list app also shows the current date to the user, which is created using a method called toLocaleDateString.
